# JetPack_Enhanced_Face_Recognition

## What is this project
I wrote this project to practice the Jetpack MVVM & share my experiences
implementation of face recognition powered by some FaceEngine SDK.
During my last job, I implemented 4 FaceEngines provided by 4 different
companies. They are mostly similar to each other, only one of them needs
to implement their build-in face lib.

I chose the ArcSoft FaceEngine SDK for this project because of they APIs
and document are better in my opinion.

## Why would I start this
As I said, this is a demo project. I share my understanding of the face
recognition process with you through this project, and I hope you can
offer me some advices in the Issue. Another key point is the Jetpack,
I'm of it and I believe it's the best way to build a modern App so far.

## How to run
Register a developer account to get your AppID & SdkKey and input them
into
[gradle.properties](https://github.com/NARUTONBM/JetPack_Enhanced_Face_Recognition/blob/master/gradle.properties)
file, then just hit it!
